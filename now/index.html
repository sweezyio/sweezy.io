    Still working towards my goal of transferring to Georgia Tech, as of right now I am on track to meet that goal.
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    This semester I am trying to develop some more robust study strategies and keep on top of my assignments better than last semester.
  </p>

  <h2 class="pt4">Work</h2>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    I <i>finally</i> quit my long-term job at [large pizza chain]. It was long overdue. Now I am down to my work-study job, which I enjoy far more than I ever liked the former.
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    I have decided that I am going to redirect my newfound free time into other productive tasks, like reading, programming, and exercise.
  </p>

  <h2 class="pt4">Self</h2>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
