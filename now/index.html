  <h2>School</h2>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    I am currently about halfway through my second semester here at Georgia Tech, and I have been absolutely loving my time here. I have met so many incredibly talented and I have learned so much more than I ever thought I would.
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    Being here hasn't come without it's challenges. I greatly underestimated the difficulty of my coursework and my GPA has suffered as a result, so this has been a humbling experience. I have also been struggling with my mental health throughout this past semester and continuing into this semester, but I am on a journey to work on that and I think I am making good progress.

  <h2 class="pt4">Future Plans</h2>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    I wasn't able to secure an internship for this coming summer, which is mildly disappointing, but I did get one interview which is more than I thought I would get.
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    I will be studying abroad in Berlin this summer, which is very exciting. This will be the first time I leave the US, so I am really excited for the opportunity.
