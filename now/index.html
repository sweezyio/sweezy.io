  <h2>School</h2>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    Finished my first year of college with a final GPA of 3.72, so I am feeling pretty good about that. 
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    As far as I can tell I now meet all of the requirements for transferring to Georgia Tech through the First-Generation Transfer Pathway program, I'll know for sure 15 June.
  </p>

  <h2 class="pt4">Summer</h2>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    I am continuing my work-study job through my school over the summer, the work I do there is interesting, fun, and fulfilling while also not being a drain on my mental health.
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    With school ending just under a month ago I am finally getting into good habits for the summer. I am putting a lot more effort into my physical health than ever before and I am actually getting results this time, which helps to keep me motivated.
  </p>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    I have a few trips and concerts planned for the summer that are meant to be a sort of last hoorah before I get really into my studies next year (either at GT or otherwise), the changes will be reflected on my <a href="../map" class="link underline light-gray hover-white">travel map</a>.
